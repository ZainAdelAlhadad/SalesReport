Sales Report 1Qrt 2019 Project using MS-Power BI

My Project 'Sales Report for 1Qrt 2019' using Power BI.

**I explored the data, cleaned it, and made sure it was all good. After that, I started extracting these insights.**
In this report there were questions that were answered, such as:

-What is the Gross income, Cost of goods sold, and Total sales?

-Relationship of total sales to Cities and Branches?

-What is the Total sales of individual Production lines?

-What is the Total sales during the Months and based on Gender?
